**CONNECTIVE HTML** is a front-end library allowing creation of reactive html-based UIs. It uses explicit flow management
of [**CONNECTIVE**](https://connective.dev) to avoid reliance on intermediary layers such as change-detection or VDOM,
resulting in frontend code that is

- really performant: since there is no magical layer between your code and the actual DOM, there is no performance overhead
- highly controllable: since you do not need to wrestle with layers underneath your logic
- highly portable: since you can easily embed the resulting components anywhere with minimal bundle-size overhead
